# 🧠 Toxic Comment Classification

A multi-label text classification system to detect toxic, obscene, insulting, and hateful comments using:

- ✅ TF-IDF with ML models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes)
- 🧠 Deep learning architectures (BiLSTM, BiGRU, TextCNN)
- 🤖 Transformers (DistilBERT)

The project compares performance across models, addresses class imbalance, and deploys results in a Streamlit app.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Online platforms struggle to moderate toxic content. This project builds a multi-label classification system to detect toxic, obscene, threatening, and hateful comments using classical ML, deep learning, and transformer-based models.

---

## 💼 Business Use Case

Helps platforms like forums, social media, and comment sections automatically flag harmful content, improving user safety and experience.

---

## 📖 Overview

This project focuses on detecting toxic language in online comments. The dataset contains user comments labeled into multiple categories of toxicity:

- toxic
- severe toxic
- obscene
- threat
- insult
- identity hate

It is a multi-label text classification problem — a comment may belong to more than one category.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Preprocess text (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal)
- Apply TF-IDF vectorization for baseline models
- Build classical ML baselines (Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes)
- Explore deep learning models (BiLSTM, BiGRU, CNN)
- Fine-tune a Transformer (DistilBERT) for contextual understanding
- Evaluate and compare model performance

---

## 📊 Dataset

- Source: [Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge)
- Train size: ~160k comments
- Test size: ~64k comments
- Labels: Multi-label, highly imbalanced

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

1. Text Cleaning:
   - Lowercasing
   - Removing URLs, HTML tags, numbers, punctuation, and extra spaces
2. Tokenization & Stopword Removal (using NLTK)
3. Vectorization:
   - TF-IDF baseline (top 5000 features)
   - Tokenizer + Padding for deep models

---

## 🧪 Models

### 🔹 Baseline (TF-IDF + Classical ML)

- Logistic Regression (One-vs-Rest)
- Linear SVM (One-vs-Rest)
- Multinomial Naive Bayes

### 🔹 Deep Learning Models

- BiLSTM (captures long-range sequential dependencies)
- BiGRU (lightweight alternative to LSTM)
- TextCNN (captures local n-gram patterns)

### 🔹 Transformers

- DistilBERT Fine-Tuning (contextual embeddings, best for nuanced toxic patterns)

## 📈 Results

### ✅ Baseline Models

| Model                   | Accuracy | Macro Precision | Macro Recall | Macro F1 |
|------------------------|----------|-----------------|--------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression     | 91.9%    | 0.76            | 0.38         | 0.49     |
| Linear SVM              | 93.1%    | 0.86            | 0.55         | 0.66     |
| Multinomial Naive Bayes | 91.4%    | 0.63            | 0.31         | 0.41     |

### 🔍 Deep Learning Highlights

- BiLSTM: Strong on frequent labels (toxic, obscene, insult), weaker on rare ones
- TextCNN: Improved recall for minority labels like `threat`
- BiGRU: Balanced performance with faster training

### 🧠 Transformer (DistilBERT)

- Outperformed classical and RNN/CNN models
- Best macro F1 across all categories

## ⚙️ Installation & Usage

### Environment Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ut-si-ch/Toxic-Comment-Classification.git
cd Toxic-Comment-Classification

conda create -n toxicity_env python=3.9
conda activate toxicity_env

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook Toxicity_Project.ipynb
```

### Streamlit App (Deployment)

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Classical ML (TF-IDF + SVM) provides strong baselines
- Deep models (BiLSTM, GRU, CNN) learn semantic and sequential patterns
- Transformers (DistilBERT) capture context & nuance best, especially for rare labels
- Class imbalance significantly impacts minority label detection (handled with sample weighting / focal loss)
